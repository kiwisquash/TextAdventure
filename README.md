This is going to be my first text adventure game.

The main goal of this project is for me to become familiar with OOP.

This is an on-going project with no end date.

# Desired features

- A functional text adventure maze game
- Randomizable map
- Different types of rooms
- items, enemies, battles
- GUI? (distant future)
- Key listerns? (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11918999/key-listeners-in-python)
- Some way to add pauses in a meaningful way.
    - Currently, everything is too fast.
- Find some nice images we can use to create the map.

# Time investment
- As of now, I am planning to sink 2 hr / week on this project.
