# Introduction 

I am going to design a Choose-Your-Own adventure type game.

# Idea

Player will read some text. At certain points, players will be asked to make a decision. Depending on the decision, the player will see a different scenario.

# Storyline

???

# Things needed

- Some kind of a game engine?
- Way of displaying text
    - Showing one character at a time... make it feel like it is being typed out.
    - Sound effect.
    - Way to speed up the text via keyboard in case the reader gets tired waiting.
    - Special field where player can choose between two choices
        - Ideally, some dialogue box pops up, and the player can choose between one of the two choices. The one that the player chooses highlights, and some confirmation
        - Keyboard shortcut
        - Ability to override confirmation
